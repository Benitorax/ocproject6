        ['Fakie ollie (Switch Nollie)', 'Straight airs', 'While riding switch, the snowboarder springs off of their \'new nose\' and into the air. This resembles an ollie, but the snowboarder is riding in switch.'],
        ['Shifty', 'Straight airs', 'An aerial trick in which a snowboarder counter-rotates their upper body in order to shift their board about 90° from its normal position beneath them, and then returns the board to its original position before landing. This trick can be performed frontside or backside, and also in variation with other tricks and spins.'],
        ['Air-to-fakie', 'Straight airs', 'Airing straight out of a vertical transition (halfpipe, quarterpipe) and then re-entering fakie, without rotation.'],
        ['Beef Curtains', 'Grabs', 'A Roast Beef and Grosman (in between the legs) at the same time. Also known as The King or Steak Tar Tar'],
        ['Bloody Dracula', 'Grabs', 'A trick in which the rider grabs the tail of the board with both hands. The rear hand grabs the board as it would do it during a regular tail-grab but the front hand blindly reaches for the board behind the riders back.'],
        ['Canadian Bacon', 'Grabs', 'The rear hand reaches behind the rear leg to grab the toe edge between the bindings while the rear leg is boned.'],
        ['Cab', 'Spins', 'It generally refers to any switch-frontside spin (no matter what the amount of rotation) on any feature (halfpipe, jumps, rails, boxes).'],
        ['Alley-oop', 'Spins', 'It is a spin performed in a halfpipe or quarterpipe in which the spin is rotated in the opposite direction of the air.'],
        ['Hard Way', 'Spins', 'A term used when spinning onto a feature or off a jump using your opposite edge to start the direction of your spin.'],
        ['Layout Backflip', 'Flips and inverted rotations', 'A variation of a regular backflip, but you fully extend your body for the first half of the rotation. This can be done barrel, or more in the wildcat style of backflip.'],
        ['Wildcat', 'Flips and inverted rotations', 'A backflip performed on a straight jump, with an axis of rotation in which the snowboarder flips in a backward, cartwheel-like fashion. A double wildcat is called a supercat.'],
        ['Superman Flip', 'Flips and inverted rotations', 'A variation of the Tamedog, where you fully extend your body for the first half of the rotation, and then tuck up before you land to finish the rotation. Most commonly done off of larger jumps.'],
        ['Handplant', 'Inverted hand plants', 'A 180° degree handplant in which the rear hand is planted on the lip of the wall and the rotation is frontside.'],
        ['Elguerial', 'Inverted hand plants', 'An invert where the halfpipe wall is approached fakie, the rear hand is planted, a 360 degree backside rotation is made, and the rider lands going forward. Named after Eddie Elguera.'],
        ['Eggflip', 'Inverted hand plants', 'An eggplant where the rider chooses to flip over in order to re-enter the pipe instead or rotating 180 degrees. This trick is performed forward to fakie or switch (fakie to forward).'],
        ['Boardslide', 'Slides', 'A slide performed where the riders leading foot passes over the rail on approach, with their snowboard traveling perpendicular along the rail or other obstacle. When performing a frontside boardslide, the snowboarder is facing uphill. When performing a backside boardslide, a snowboarder is facing downhill. This is often confusing to new riders learning the trick because with a frontside boardslide you are moving backward and with a backside boardslide you are moving forward.'],
        ['Bluntslide', 'Slides', 'A slide performed where the rider\'s leading foot passes over the rail on approach, with their snowboard traveling perpendicular and trailing foot directly above the rail or other obstacle (like a tailslide). When performing a frontside bluntslide, the snowboarder is facing uphill. When performing a backside bluntslide, the snowboarder is facing downhill.'],
        ['Noseblunt', 'Slides', 'A slide performed where the rider\'s trailing foot passes over the rail on approach, with their snowboard traveling perpendicular and leading foot directly above the rail or other obstacle (like a noseslide). When performing a frontside noseblunt, the snowboarder is facing downhill. When performing a backside noseblunt, the snowboarder is facing uphill.'],
        ['One-footed', 'Stalls', 'Tricks performed with one foot removed from the binding (typically the rear foot) are referred to as one-footed tricks. One footed tricks include fast plants in which the rear foot is dropped and initiates a straight air or rotation, the boneless, which is a fast-plant with a grab; and the no-comply, which is a front-footed fast plant.'],
        ['Shifty', 'Stalls', 'An aerial trick in which a snowboarder twists their body, rotating their board 90° and then returning it to its original position before landing. This trick can be performed frontside or backside, and also in variation with other tricks and spins.'],
        ['Tuck knee', 'Stalls', 'Where the knee of either leg is dropped down to touch the top of the board. When referring to snowboarding it means that the rider attempts to put their knee on the board by putting their knee underneath the torso and then pulling down to the board.'],
        ['Jib', 'Miscellaneous tricks and identifiers', 'To ride on any surface that is not snow, or to ride on any feature in a non-traditional way. I.e. tapping or spinning on a death cookie or snow embankment.'],
        ['Butter', 'Miscellaneous tricks and identifiers', 'While traveling along the surface of the snow, this trick is performed by pressuring either the nose or tail of the snowboard in such a way that the opposite half of the snowboard lifts off of the snow, allowing for a pivot-like rotation. A butter can be performed as a partial rotation (90°), which is then reverted, as a continuous rotation (180°, 360°, etc.), or as a lead-in to an aerial maneuver. (butters are similar to blunt slides in skateboarding)'],
        ['Pretzel', 'Miscellaneous tricks and identifiers', 'Concluding a slide trick with a 270° spin opposite the direction in which you did a rotation during the trick\'s initiation.'],
